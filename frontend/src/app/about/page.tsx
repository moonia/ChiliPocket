          About the Project
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          This project was created as part of the <span className="text-[#ff004f] font-semibold">Chiliz Hackathon 2025</span>, with the mission of merging the thrill of live events and sports fandom with the power of Web3 technology.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          We took inspiration from <strong>POAPs</strong> (Proof of Attendance Protocols), which are digital collectibles that act as verifiable memories of participation. These unique tokens are tied to events, matches, or key moments â€” giving fans something to own, cherish, and show off forever.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Our goal was to reimagine this concept through an interactive and gamified experience: fans can now scan tickets, mint NFT cards, and climb the leaderboard by actively participating in real-world or online events.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          The NFTs and POAPs minted through our platform are secured on the <span className="text-[#ff004f] font-semibold">Chiliz blockchain</span>, ensuring authenticity, ownership, and transparency.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed">
          Whether you&apos;re a hardcore fan, a collector, or simply curious about the future of fandom in Web3, this project is for you. Join us, start collecting, and let your passion shine on-chain.
