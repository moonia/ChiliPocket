# üå∂Ô∏è Chiliz Hackathon - ChiliPocket

> _Revolutionizing Fan Engagement Through Blockchain & NFC Technology_

## üéØ Vision & Core Concept
#### The Fan Experience Revolution
ChiliPocket enables fans to collect POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol NFTs) when attending live sports events across the globe.

Using NFC technology embedded at stadium gates or event zones, fans can tap their phone or ticket to mint a unique NFT badge directly to their wallet on the Chiliz Chain (a verifiable, non-transferable proof that "I was there").

These collectible memories become part of a fan's on-chain identity, allowing for:

- A personal global fan passport

- Access to exclusive content, raffles, or merchandise

- Loyalty rewards for superfans who attend multiple events or visit iconic venues

- Gamification with leaderboards and achievements

## ‚öΩ Why It Matters

This project ties directly into the core values of Chiliz:

- Fan Ownership: POAPs are minted to individual wallets and cannot be faked or transferred.

- Engagement: Fans are rewarded not just for spending, but for showing up.


## üöÄ Getting started
To run the project locally, simply clone the repository and follow these steps.

### üõ† Requirements
- Node.js >= 18

- Metamask Wallet (Chiliz Testnet)

- NFC-enabled device

### Contracts 
#### Dependencies

Before writing or deploying your contracts, make sure to install the following libraries:

```
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
We use Thirdweb for an efficient and developer-friendly deployment workflow of our smart contracts on the Chiliz Chain.

#### Install the CLI
To get started, install the Thirdweb CLI as a dev dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev @thirdweb-dev/cli
```

#### Deploy via CLI
Once your contract is ready, deploy it using:

```
npx thirdweb deploy -k $THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY
```

This will deploy the smart contract to the specified network (e.g., Chiliz Spicy testnet) and return the contract address.

> Make sure you‚Äôve set your THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY in your .env file.

#### Testing Interactions

You can test contract functions via:
- The Thirdweb web dashboard
- Using CLI tools like cast from Foundry:

```
cast send <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "functionName(type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ...)" \
  --private-key <YOUR_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --rpc-url https://chiliz-spicy.publicnode.com \
  --gas-price <SOME_GWEI> \
  --gas-limit <GAS_LIMIT>
```

Replace the placeholders with actual values according to your smart contract.

### Frontend

Duplicate the .env.example file into .env and fill the required variables based on your environment.

Then you just need to install the dependencies and start the project:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Mobile

ChiliPocket is designed to work smoothly on mobile devices, especially for users scanning NFC tags at live events to mint their POAPs.

**Core mobile features:**

- NFC tag reading to trigger POAP minting

- Wallet connection (MetaMask Mobile, WalletConnect)

- POAP gallery and user dashboard

#### Manual Mobile Setup (PWA or Mobile Browser)

To test the project on mobile manually:

1. Run the project locally:

```
npm run dev
```

2. Access the app from your phone:

- Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer

- Find your local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.25)

- Open a browser on your phone and go to:
http://192.168.1.25:3000

3. Add to Home Screen (PWA):

- On iOS (Safari) or Android (Chrome), tap ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù

> This makes the app feel like a native experience

### Image Hosting ‚Äì IPFS & Pinata

All product or user images used in the application are stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to ensure decentralized, tamper-resistant storage.
We use Pinata as our IPFS pinning service to upload, manage, and persist these files across the network.

When a new image is uploaded, it's pinned to IPFS via Pinata and the resulting CID (Content Identifier) is stored and referenced by the application.

## üì£ Future Ideas

- Leaderboards for "most-traveled" fans

- Social sharing features to show off POAPs

- Partnership program with clubs to whitelist event POAPs
