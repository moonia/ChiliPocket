# 🌶️ Chiliz Hackathon - ChiliPocket

> _Revolutionizing Fan Engagement Through Blockchain & NFC Technology_

## 🎯 Vision & Core Concept
#### The Fan Experience Revolution
ChiliPocket enables fans to collect POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol NFTs) when attending live sports events across the globe.

Using NFC technology embedded at stadium gates or event zones, fans can tap their phone or ticket to mint a unique NFT badge directly to their wallet on the Chiliz Chain (a verifiable, non-transferable proof that "I was there").

These collectible memories become part of a fan's on-chain identity, allowing for:

- A personal global fan passport

- Access to exclusive content, raffles, or merchandise

- Loyalty rewards for superfans who attend multiple events or visit iconic venues

- Gamification with leaderboards and achievements

## ⚽ Why It Matters

This project ties directly into the core values of Chiliz:

- Fan Ownership: POAPs are minted to individual wallets and cannot be faked or transferred.

- Engagement: Fans are rewarded not just for spending, but for showing up.
